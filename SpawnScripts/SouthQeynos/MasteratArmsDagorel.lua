--No review of the gnolls is complete without mention of the most famous gnoll in history, Fippy Darkpaw, a member of the Sabertooth Clan of gnolls.  Fippy Darkpaw specialized in planning elaborate attacks on the main gates of Qeynos during the Age of Turmoil.  While his fate is unknown, his descendants formed the base of the numerous Darkpaw gnolls in Antonica.
--We Qeynosians have always been a peaceful people, striving to coexist in harmony with all of natureâ€™s creatures.  But the gnolls are an abomination with no rightful place in this land.  They are a threat that must be eliminated!   Do not pity the gnolls.  They show no pity for their victims.  If allowed, they will multiply and overrun every corner of civilization, leaving a swath of blood in their path.  As citizens, we must protect Qeynos and her outlying regions.  We must slay these curs until none remain! Each one of you who ventures beyond our city gates ... you are duty-bound to draw your sword against the gnolls, and do not lower your blade until it is crimson with gnollish blood!

--[[
Brawlers don't waste their time strapping on bulky armor. Sometimes the only weapons they use are their fists, and they dodge their opponent's blows with the swiftness of a hawk.  Do you choose this path?
Warriors run to the front line in battle and care only about slaughtering the enemy and oiling their weapons with their foe's blood.  Warriors know might makes right.  Do you choose this path?
None matches the conviction of a crusader. Crusaders fight for a cause. This cause gives them the strength to crush their opponents beneath their feet. The last thing that people see when they fight a crusader is a cold, dead look -- their own reflection in the crusader's eyes.  Do you choose this path?
]]--

--Indeed it is. I do not mean to sound boastful but it is a great honor to serve the Qeynos Guard. There is no honor greater in my mind. This is why I have devoted my life to its cause. You have what is needed to be great within the Guard. All that is needed is some experience under your sword. You are getting there, so it's time to put those skills to the test!
--Indeed it is. I do not mean to sound boastful but it is a great honor to serve the Qeynos Guard. There is no honor greater in my mind. Thus why I have devoted my life to its cause. You have what is needed to be great within the Guard. All that is needed is some experience under your sword. Return to me once you are a bit more experienced and we will get you on the right path to being a true hero among the Qeynos Guard.
--The Qeynos Guard demands from its recruits adherence to a code of honor and justice.
--[QUEST 2] Good!  The guards deserve some words of encouragement. If you use that type of thinking on the battlefield, you'll understand what drives a crusader.



--[FINAL SELECTION] Well, then, I showed you three different fighting styles--you know my preferred way of fighting--trusting a good axe and a breastplate. You experienced the raw fighting power of a brawler, and finally, you witnessed the dedication of a crusader. Now it's time to test your knowledge...
--You have to make a choice!  You got potential, you do, and it would be a sore shame to see you waste it!  But you can't be a fighter your entire life. You gotta focus on one of the styles I showed you, if you wanna go places.  So what will it be, eh?



--Brawlers use their brains, they do. They don't need armor if their enemies can't hit 'em.  They also know they can't be disarmed if they have built-in weapons. Well, they can, but that' messy business that we don't need to discuss. So, are ya willin' to push yourself to the limit as a brawler?
--Brawlers don't waste their time strapping on bulky armor. Sometimes the only weapons they use are their fists, and they dodge their opponent's blows with the swiftness of a hawk.  Do you choose this path?
--If you're a true brawler, you need to undergo a challenge.  In order to join the ranks of the brawlers here in Qeynos, you gotta prove your skills. Enter the dojo and go fist to fist against another brawler.  If you manage to defeat 'em, you'll become that which you seek.

--Thank you, Dagorel.  I won't forget your lessons.
--Aye, aye.  The watchmen informed me. They say you held your own. That's what I want to hear! You had to prove your fightin' skills--I don't want anyone accusing ol' Dagorel of sending ill-equipped kids off to their deaths. You proved you got what it takes, kid. Good work.

--Yes.  I will train everyday to master the art of pugilism.  I am a brawler.
--I like relying on my fists in battle. I want to be a brawler.
--Through training, I can make my own body into a weapon.  I'm a brawler.
--Understand one more thing as well ...  when you defeat your last opponent, meditate at the altar in the dojo.  A brawler is not only strong of body but also of mind.  Strengthening both is mandatory.  Once you do this, you'll have proven yourself.

--BRAWLER ALTAR A cool breeze swirls around you, sending a tingle up the back of your spine.  You arise from the altar and know in your soul that you are a brawler.
--CRUSADER START It's not as easy as that, youngin'.  You don't just declare yourself a crusader, or did you learn nothing from my previous lessons?  No, crusader is a title earned by those with enough heart to consider the fair city of Qeynos and its inhabitants first and themselves a distant second.
--I feel naked without a weapon in my hand.  I believe I'm a warrior.
--A warrior, are ya? You're sayin' that the best way to fix a problem is with a bit of hammered steel?  Aye, I agree with that!  When you got a slaverin' gnoll runnin' at you, hard bent for leather, well, you'd be a ninny not to draw steel.  So, the life of the warrior is your path in life, is it?
--Yes.  I prefer to take care of a problem, rather than let it take care of me.  I am a warrior!
--Whoa, now! Not yet, you're not!  You have to prove you can last in the fray. You didn't think I'd wave a magic wand and make you a warrior, did you?  No, no, we got a make shift arena set up in the warehouse, where you'll prove yourself, a true warrior of Qeynos. No need to return to me, I've taught you all I can.
